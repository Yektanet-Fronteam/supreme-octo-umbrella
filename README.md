- A listing page of characters.
- Use infinite scroll for pagination.
- Implement two filters Based on "species" and "status"
- On hover of each row, show a tooltip containing "image," "name" and "species" of character.
- On click of each row, go to a detail page with full data about the character.
- Use either TanStack Query, Apollo Client, or Relay. It has a plus point in order.
